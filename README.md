# Text Similarity

## Overview
This project encompasses the development and deployment of a text similarity algorithm using sentence transformers, hosted as a server API on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The API provides an efficient and accessible solution for comparing semantic similarities between texts

#### Part A: Model Development
The model is developed in Python, utilizing the powerful sentence-transformers library. It is capable of converting text into embeddings and uses cosine similarity to evaluate the degree of similarity between texts.

#### Part B: Deployment on GCP
eployment of the model as a server API on GCP using Flask
